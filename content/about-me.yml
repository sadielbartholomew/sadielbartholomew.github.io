  More information about me

# GENERAL AND AFFILIATIONS ETC. -----------------------------------------------

overall_summary_paragraph: >
  I am a UK-based Research Software Engineer in the domain of earth,
  environmental and aligned research. Namely, I work as a
  Computational Scientist for the National Centre for Atmospheric Science
  (NCAS) and for, and based at, the University of Reading, as well as
  a private contractor for the University of Edinburgh.<br><br>

  Related to these roles, I am a Fellow for
  the Software Sustainability Institute, recognising my dedication to
  'advancing the sustainability of software' across the fields I work in, as
  well as a Certified Instructor for The Carpentries, familiar with
  evidence-based teaching practice with focus on training relating to
  software and data.<br><br>

  Unlike a traditional scientist, day-to-day I mostly develop and consider
  software, though I do contribute sometimes to academic papers (my
  published name is Sadie L. Bartholomew).<br><br>

  My interests relating to the above include, as well as science and computing
  more broadly, particularly for lines of work I have been involved in:
  open-source software, workflows, metadata,
  high-performance computing (HPC), green computing (including green
  HPC!), data/simulation infrastructure and digital twinning,
  especially when these are in relation to
  earth system modelling e.g. for study of weather and climate.<br><br>

  In my spare time I am a visual artist, working on pieces from traditional
  to algorithmic and somewhere in between.<br><br>

  My interests more generally include visual art in most forms; rock, punk,
  metal and alternative (and similar genres of) music; playing guitar (both
  classical and electric) and playing around with guitar pedals and FX; chess;
  walking and hiking;
  cycling; poetry; reading;
  (following - sadly no longer playing) football; mindfulness;
  nature and wildlife (esp. birds e.g. bird watching); and vegan food/cookery.
  <br><br>

  I live in Reading, Berkshire, but was born and grew up in the North East
  of England (first Newcastle-upon-Tyne and then South Northumberland) where
  my family are still based.
