# GENERAL AND AFFILIATIONS ETC. -----------------------------------------------

overall_summary_paragraph: >
  I am a UK-based Senior Research Software Engineer (or Computational
  Scientist) in the domain of earth, environmental and aligned research,
  with a focus on atmospheric science (such as meteorology) due to my
  affiliations: I work for the National Centre
  for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) and for (and based at) the University of
  Reading, as well as a private contractor doing work for clients such as the
  University of Edinburgh.<br><br>

  Related to these roles, I am a Fellow for
  the Software Sustainability Institute, recognising my dedication to
  'advancing the sustainability of software' across the fields I work in, as
  well as a Certified Instructor for The Carpentries, familiar with
  evidence-based teaching practice with focus on training relating to
  software and data.<br><br>

  Unlike a traditional scientist, day-to-day I mostly develop and consider
  software, though I do conduct some research and contribute to some academic
  papers (my published name is Sadie L. Bartholomew).<br><br>

  My interests relating to the above include, as well as science and computing
  more broadly, particularly for lines of work I have been involved in:
  open-source software, workflows, metadata,
  high-performance computing (HPC), green computing (including green
  HPC!), data/simulation infrastructure and digital twinning,
  especially when these are in relation to
  earth system modelling e.g. for study of weather and climate.<br><br>

  In my spare time I am a visual artist, often working on pieces from
  traditional to algorithmic and somewhere in between. This includes
  using anything from standard manual techniques such as painting and
  drawing to algorithmic ones such as creative coding and for modular origami
  making.<br><br>

  My interests more generally include visual art in most forms; music
  especially rock, punk, metal, alternative and some forms of classical;
  playing guitar (both classical and electric) and playing around with
  mixing/producing and FX (pedals and virtual/plugins); chess; walking
  and hiking (anywhere!); (off-road) cycling and in the spring/summer
  (cruiser / A to B) skateboarding;
  following football (predominantly Newcastle United); poetry; reading; 
  mindfulness; nature and wildlife; and vegan food/cookery.
  <br><br>

  I live in Reading, Berkshire, but was born and grew up in the North East
  of England (first Newcastle-upon-Tyne and then South Northumberland) where
  most of my family are still based.
