  my artwork of local urban landscapes & buildings


# INTRO -----------------------------------------------------------------------

intro_paragraph: >
  I like doing landscapes & naturally I have focused on decpicting places
  close to home, wherever that has been at the time.

  I was schooled, & from age 12 grew up in, a large village
  in the South of Northumberland called Ponteland. There are
  several sights there striking enough to draw/paint, but I think
  this is my favourite of those I did, one of the well-known pubs near
  the village centre:

  Pont is ~15 km south-east(ish) from the city of Newcastle-upon-Tyne
  which naturally I spent a lot of time in as a child & teenager. If people
  ask me where I am from usually I will just say Newcastle since not many
  people (in my experience at least) from outside of the North East can
  place Northumberland on the map. Most in the UK will probably have some
  familiarity with the iconic Quayside and the bridges there, a view which
  was a very natural candidate to draw:

  I went to university also in the North East of England,
  slightly further South again in the beautiful city of
  Durham. You are spolit for choice for lovely sights in Durham, not least
  the incredible iconic cathedral, but my favourite artwork of mine of
  Durham is definitely a painting I did of my college, St Chad's. For one
  because the college sold prints of it so when I visit university friends
  I often see it up on their walls. That always makes me really happy.

# OUTRO -----------------------------------------------------------------------

outro_paragraph: >
  I moved to Exeter for work and have since moved to Reading. I didn't find
  Exeter very exciting visually. There is a cathedral there which I could've
  drawn or painted but it never felt interesting enough to start on (Durham
  has spoilt me in that respect). Dartmoor is relatively close to Exeter
  however and obviously very easy on the eye so I have some paintings of that
  which I am (slowly) working on.

  And I have lots of candidates for Reading landscapes lined up when I am
  at a stage I can start on something new...
