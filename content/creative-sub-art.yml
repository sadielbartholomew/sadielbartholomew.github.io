  I am also showcasing my art and design work via Instagram (as linked
  in the row of icons at the top of the homepage of this site) to try to
  extend the reach and to gain inspiration, and interact with, various
  art and design communities. But in these pages I can showcase related
  work and collections together rather than standalone, in higher-resolution,
  and along with commentary and/or notes. So the pages added here will be a
  more integrated and detailed account of my art and design than the Instagram
  gallery page:
