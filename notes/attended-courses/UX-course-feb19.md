## Day 1


### Intro to course

UX is:

* about the performance, not just the design or “aesthetic”
* “the science & discipline of design performance”
* is not just UI, it “has a lot more to say”


##### Apollo 16 film clip

<link>

Three lessons from it about UX. UX is...

1. **problem solving** for others; in doing UX design we are being
   **knowledge workers**.
2. **collaborative**; it values **diversity** of thought & expertise in the
   problem solving.
3. “for the **real world**”; it focuses on the **parameters** in the problem
   to solve.


##### Exercise 1

Question to the group: define UX, first independently then in a group of 2 or 3

Teacher’s thoughts & feedback after the exercise:

* “All design influences behaviour”: “users have an emotional response to how
  we treat them with our products”

* “Control is important”: we don’t like it when our control is taken away.
  Example of controversy of U2 free album, & autoplaying.

* There is a focus on goals: “users want to get things done”, & it is about
  their “needs and wants”

Group discussion on frustrating digital experiences they have had:

* it is not just “to design” but “to define” the user’s experience.

* “we can make users feel angry”, usually when they are trying to do
  something standard (i.e. not unusual), & they have difficulty doing so.

* But anger is not the only, or worst, negative emotion that we can make the
  user feel: can make the user **feel stupid**, where you want to make them
  **feel empowered**. Though while some would assume “I am stupid” others
  would assume “they (i.e. the designers, we) are stupid”. Don’t want to
  make them unsure, want to give them confidence.

* Conversely, **users respond to positive experiences with loyalty** i.e.
  they become loyal and regularly use those products which treat them better,
  over equivalent alternatives. Example: Whatsapp, which took on the very
  large market of text messaging, with a unique selling point of being very
  good at group text messaging. It’s success in such a large market was
  largely down to good UX.

* Terminology: the standard term is “user” but could also say “customer”,
  though ultimately the teacher prefers the term “human”, as ultimately this
  is what it is, but couldn’t call his company a “human experience (HX)” one
  as that would get no Google search hits! Just a label really, though.

* Imagine that you could observe i.e. watch over various users to see what
  they do. The key is how we make users feel, so we need to try to predict
  their emotion.

* Big companies such as Google & Amazon set the bar and set it high; they
  have “democratised good UX”.

Teacher’s summary: gives Wikipedia definition, & adds “what it feels like to use a product, system or service”.


##### “3 lenses of UX” with case study examples:

UX “views design through various **lenses** which make up the design, the three core ones being:

1. Functional
2. Aesthetic
3. Experience i.e. performance

##### Case study 1: Luxury cars e.g. Mercedes

* In the luxury car industry, the ‘experience’ lens comprises an obsession with the little details e.g. the exact design & feel of the leather seats, though it is also the broader picture as well as the details.
* This study highlights how the “3 lens” components above are not independent, since for example visual impression can influence expectations on performance, as in the 

##### Case study 2 (software-based example): Blackberry 10 smartphone

* Short (a few minutes) video clip shown of users trying out a new BlackBerry product for the first time.
* BlackBerry 10 phone: unusual (non-intuitive) ways to access things
* “foreign” and “strange” were some of the user comments from the video: that’s not good!
* did not consider the third lens (experience), only the first two (functional & aesthetic)
* compare Blackberry’s and Apple’s approach to innovation: Apple usually simply took existing products and made them better. But they **prioritised innovations in terms of the user’s (& overall the market’s) ability to tolerate them**, leading with priorities e.g. Apple’s “gesture scroll” on their music app, where could scroll from the top to the bottom of the songs listing. Actually, BlackBerry had first pioneered a similar swipe gesture which is now so common to do this, but it was too confusing when they introduced it grouped with lots of other unfamiliar innovations.
* “co-design with your users”

### Course organisation & themes

Arranged into modules:

4. Designing the Experience
5. ?
6. ?

### The design process

* From 60s and 70s: “research => design => build => test”. The user is only involved in the first and last stages here i.e. it was only “book-ended” by the user. Case Study of Sony & Toyota outlined.
* Later, companies such as Google and Amazon were the originators for “redefining design as a process”, where they introduced a **culture** whereby “everyone takes ownership in design, it concerns everyone”. So, in the 90s the process was different, having a **new iterative piece** for designing, prototyping & validating:

“research => define => design [into circular bit which starts here]=> prototype => validate => design [end of circular bit]”
then off from circle: “prototype => build => test”

where the validation stage now had two components: **sign-off required** not just by the organisation, as before, but **also by the user**.
* Now, the process is **continuous deployment** i.e. “always-on development”. It is a circle:

“research [start of circle] => design => prototype => build => test => research [end of circle]”

The culture here is that “the product is always improveable” so that “once it goes live, that is not the end but the start”.

Analogy from the construction industry: “you can use an eraser on the plans, or a sledgehammer on the building site” i.e. the later you recognise changes that need to be made, the more expensive it will be to make them. “UX is the business of risk mitigation”.

##### Why UX in technology is difficult

* UX in software: previously it was called HCI (human-computer interface).
Can summarise with a great Leo Cherne quote: “The computer is incredibly fast, accurate, and stupid. Man is unbelievably slow, inaccurate, and brilliant. The marriage of the two is a force beyond calculation.” In short, computers & humans have completely different interfaces! Therefore the aim is to *soften the computer interface* so it fits better with the human one.
* Examples of the telephone & the remote control: three images are shown each for the two appliances from across the past ~50 years. They are discussed, with emphasis on the increasing complexity in terms of features. “The fewer features, the easier it is to achieve simple, intuitive/effortless design”. More features require more controls, which will always be less simple.
* The key is that “not all functions & features are created equal!” Can, & with a high number one needs to, make some elements dominate and demote the others. Prioritise “use cases”.
* Examples: with the remote control, the average user almost always only uses up to 10% of all buttons (and likely have no idea what many of the others even do), and yet in most remote controls all the buttons are a very similar size! That’s a design flaw. Another example given: the Nokia phone. Another example: word processors, where demote very uncommon functions from the top visible icon bar to the ‘Menu’ item. Another example would be software for the purchase of train tickets, where it would ask you where you want to collect those tickets from. In most cases, users will naturally want to collect from the station they are leaving from, so have that as the default, with a link to account for any “edge cases” for when they otherwise do not want this, which would be much better than a drop-down list of all options for stations to collect from.
* Note: the “business need” has precedence over the “user need”, though, so in the final example above, there may not be an option to post the tickets as it would be too expensive to the business, even if it would satisfy a user need.

##### Exercise: redesigning the remote control

* Group asked to re-design the remote control to take into account the above i.e. where the most important features are make dominant.
* Teacher’s comments after exercise: “overall, the best solutions probably are those that have a physical device as a pointer and clicker to a **smart app type piece of software**, not purely hardware-based” That way, it can be customisable to account for the fact that different people watch TV in different ways.
* Overall lesson: “software has features, but users have goals”: so “goal-directed design” is key.

##### BMW case study

* Video shown of potential new BMW car designs being moulded and smoothed out to create very realistically-shaped clay models, which are then plated and painted. These clay models are taken out into various environments the cars would appear in real life, to see how they would look physically. The clay models are very expensive, so it goes to show how important it is for BMW to see their car designs in a range of realistic contexts, i.e. “out of the lab”.
* Similarly, architects create designs as modelled at e.g. different times of day, to reflect the differing sunlight levels and angles.
* In the software industry, the prototype is the equivalent to the clay model. It enables goal-driven design in software.

#### User and usability research

* The course up until has discussed “doing it”, & now we go onto discussing “how we can go about doing it”.
* There are two core and distinct categories to test on: observational (i.e. behaviour) & attitudinal (opinion). It is best to ask questions about **past behaviour**, not opinion, as past behaviour is the best indicator of future behaviour.
* A study is referenced where it was determined that generally “only need to test a low (~10) number of users to find major usability problems per flow”
* For analysing (user research) data, i.e. doing analytics, there are three main points to look at:

    1. Acquisition: how we got the user
    2. Behaviour: 
    3. Outcome: does the user seem to leave on what we would consider a “success page”.

* Teacher’s advice: “invest in your data layer” i.e. some way to gather analytics, so that you can then find out a lot more about user behaviour & motivations, etc.

#### Common user research techniques

1. **A/B testing**: provide two different screens & note the response to each one, where the better performing option is kept. Example shown of Amazon postage address choice screen, where the teacher caught them using A/B testing in-situ, as one page showed each address in a box as part of a two-column set of address boxes, the other showed the addresses in a standard one-column list. A/B tests are very common across the big tech companies e.g. Amazon, Google.
2. **Usability testing**:  where you physically observe the user.
3. **Field studies** and **contextual enquiries** (the difference between these is minimal i.e. they are largely the same): usability testing, as above, but outside of “the lab”. This is important because otherwise there is the “lab bias”, a bias of being in an artificial environment rather than the natural use-case one. In these, you often find out about the **workarounds** i.e. shortcuts that users feel compelled to use to simply do what they need to do when it is not otherwise clear or possible.
4. **card sorting** & **tree testing**: other methods, not described in detail.

* Bias is a major challenge in research, overall, but qualitative “altit.” (analysis/attitude?) is a particular “red zone” for it.
* The *quadrant diagram* is just for primary research methods. Can also do secondary research and a final type: “desk research” e.g. market research and studies into competitors.

##### Video

* interviewer goes around asking people what they think the difference between a browser and a search engine is. Of relevance to Google (c.f. Chrome).
* key point: “we are different to our users!” and we must recognise this in product design. We are in a “digital ivory tower” and we should “de-sanitise design”, i.e. design for the real world and not for the board room. References OECD which found that 10-15% of users have some sort of impairment or accessibility issue which affects their digital ability. So design for users, not for your mates who will also likely be expert users! “Universal design”. Assumptions can be dangerous.
* Referenced book by Crooks called “Don’t make me think”, a quote attributed to Ford on a “faster horse”, and a Steve Jobs quote. Lesson: “don’t research customers to ask them for a solution, research them to better understand the problem at hand, and then you yourself do the thinking and design etc. in response to the research findings. This a good way to avoid bias. Be wary of leading questions, e.g. example of Walmart survey asking “would you like our stores to be less cluttered”, which suggests a solution: you should not do that, because it a very easy way to introduce bias!

##### Basketball passing/gorilla example video

* This is a selective attention test. The bias is that we only observe what we are looking for.
* Google introduced design “culture” terms to encourage being fine with bad results, e.g. “design hypothesis” and using the term “test” instead of “validate” which implies you are correct. They have built-in a culture that “failure is okay” and where e.g. testers are encouraged to break things.

#### Usability test example: audience member acts as user under test

* One member of the course group did a UT, where they tried to book a return ferry (from a brief set by the teacher) on the StennaLine website. Examples of key things noticed were that:
  * there was no information or map on the location of places the ferries go to or from, so the user had to use a workaround and go to Google maps in another tab.
  * it was not clear if the prices given were for one-way or for the two-way return trip, until the final checkout where it became clear.
  * Too technical terminology for the user was used, i.e. “berth”.
  * There was both a ‘continue’ and a ‘checkout’ button at many stages, which the user said was annoying.
  * Double negatives were used, which was confusing.
  * Late feedback: a mandatory field was not filled out at an early stage and the user was only notified of this at the very end when they tried to checkout.

* In a UT, reassure the user that you are testing the software and not them and ask them to verbalise what they are doing and why.
* From the actual example UT in the course: “gold dust” phrases we are hearing are “I haven’t been told...”, “I had to make an assumption”, “I had to settle for this”.
* There is software available that can record the electronic actions of the user & can take video recording too. Example from course is CAMTASIA but it is not free, and free alternatives are available.

## UX training: day 2

### Analysing research data section

* not just “how can we do UX”, but “...efficiently”? That’s **Lean UX**
* concept of triangulation: using disparate data points, bring together for a more precise understanding, i.e. common themes, where they say the same thing.
* good outcomes are good skill plus good collaboration: affinity mapping.
* post it notes “have to be either *true* or *defensible*, **not opinion**.

##### Exercise:

* Did affinity diagram on Stenna UT (from day 1).

* After the exercise, teacher and participant feedback:

    1. best when people challenge each other’s post it notes.
    2. can be useful to do “dot voting” via dot stickers on points or labels that are most important to them.
    3. “tools to facilitate good discussion” rather than “as a means to an end”, i.e. to the the final diagram.

* terminology: “user flow”, “motorway”, “customer journey (plans)”, “pain points”, “entry points”, “decision points”, “user goals”, “user needs”, “conversion points”, “content priorities”.

##### Lean process

* Sony and Toyota examples again: “design is everyone’s job”
* “customer knowledge as (/is) a competitive advantage”
* the GDS site, “gov.uk” is a very good example. It gives access to public services. GDS document their design process (see online).
* usability is the new persuasion” R. Davies quote
* good process: discovery GDS stage is “ideation”: don’t restrict ideas until they are all collected and on the table. beta: typically prototyping. Overall, “want to discover failure early, as it less expensive. Hence investing in usability/UX is mitigating risk. Audience point: RE our Met Office new website is on its beta stage.
* Don’t let UX be “window dressing”, or too late, push for it at all stages. “universal design”. A management (etc.) question might be “why can’t you just get it right the first time?”! But it is not just about how to build the **product right**, it is about how to build the **right product**. Design and user feedback are required together in an iterative process to get the latter right. ‘Groundhog day’ analogy on iteration.
* Referenced a great book, “Lean UX” by Golhelf with Seiden, on design sprints, etc.
* where possible, break up projects into blocks of research, as each research process usually has a learned outcome that can respond it.
* “nimble design”: use the comms protocol (e.g. a 20 page document versus an email) that is relevant, don’t invest in polishing things up unless you need to. “DAFT.ie” example on nimble design.

Next module: Designing the Experience

* There are three concepts to consider:
    1. information architecture;
    2. (user) flow;
    3. navigation.
* RE point 2: flow is helping users move around, e.g. can have ‘expert’ and (vs) ‘novice’ flows. pages on more than one flow are typically more complex. from looking at flow, designers can introduce anticipation & empathy (e.g. for the latter case where they let the user know an email is sending as asked).
* each page should be considered always as part of some journey, not just as a destination.

##### Exercise: on flow diagram on facebook

* Each step should be as intuitive and effortless as possible. But beware of ‘barometers’ such as “as few clicks as possible”, etc., as these are pretty clunky.
*Effortlessness is a key metric. Even if flow is longer, that is fine as long as each step brings these three things:

    1. control;
    2. confidence;
    3. getting closer & closer to the goal (not “losing the scent”).

* Flow needs to be designed.
* Facebook example: lots of flows to do the same thing (permutations).
* Building “motorways” means: 1. building the right functions PLUS 2. prioritising content.
* Tesco Mobile example: show only by default the 5 most popular handsets, of ~30, with the others smaller & less prominent in view. The same is done for their plans.

##### Interaction Design

* interaction = intent + action + result
* interactions usually only influence you consciously when they go badly, otherwise they are not noticed. Interactions comprise micro-interactions, each of which can help or hinder to “glide”.
* Design patterns e.g. always use a drop-down box, not a radio button, on certain elements (“house style”.) By not standardising, a company (etc.) wastes time because each project/team has to redesign.
* Audience point out that the Met Office has its own brand and design, but it changes often and is not comprehensive.
* Map: user <=> system; intent <=> control; action <=> rules; result <=> feedback.
* want the system to work **as the user expects**.
* where to learn about controls: many organisations publish their design patterns e.g. Android, Apple, IOS.

Final bit of the jigsaw: the design piece

* six classic design principles: [listed: 5 from Donald Norman’s The Design of Everyday Things, plus “Fitts’s Law”.]
* Whether something is a *physical product*, a *service*, or some *software*, the interaction principles are the same.
* “mimic by design pattern”; differentiate by content and by design pattern” e.g. consistent iconography, e.g. play sign (triangle pointing to right).
* tell-tale sign that the design is bad is that you have to over-instruct/guide the user e.g. via “baby steps”.
* in software, want to make it clear what is on on offer and how they can get it i.e. be **perceivable**.
* be specific on what users are getting into and what they will get back.

### Day 2 afternoon session

* a **progress indicator/bar** is a “best friend”, universally, for communication of progress; says where have come from, where going to and how far along. It is typically displayed horizontally at the top.
* **forms** are generally important ingredients.
* Reference to Miss Universe 2015, where the wrong winner was announced. Reasons for this being an easy mistake based on card giving the relevant information to the announcer provided.
* Three behavioural criteria to assess forms against:

    1. motivation e.g. not intimidating;
    2. efficiency: appropriate fill-in speed;
    3. accuracy: fewest errors.

* structure, categorisation and hierarchy: are good, aim for these.
* usually single-column designs are best (i.e. the highest performing) for forms, but exceptions are e.g. for forename-surname inputs & other functionality naturally lending itself to multi-column form elements, or expert users where the trade-off on speed versus complexity pays off.
* also gently guide/nudge (“give forward momentum”) to help users along to their end goal.
* label alignment: the worst performing is flush with the edge, away from the box, as one’s eyes then need to move a lot more and work very hard, & also can’t see the labels in this scheme on mobile. Middle in performance is flush with the box. Best is just above the box, i.e. *top-aligned labels*. Also usually bad is field in text box i.e. “in-field labels” (placeholder text).
* mention: Google material design, their own design patterns, including one for labelling relative to boxes.
* Reference to ‘Baymerd’, a great company for advice on forms.
* SkyScanner is a good example for forms, e.g. with their ‘going from’ with ‘country, city or airport’ as an in-field label.

Calls to action

* Usually, you want to be as specific as possible when (near to the end goal) one click away from, but if it is important or irreversible or (especially) it costs money, use something “dramatic” e.g. a warning of what the user is about to do. This is particularly common as a confirmation screen before checkout in e-commerce.
* BUT sometimes you want the “call to action” to be **generic**, i.e. the polar opposite to the above.
* the *default position* is the most important indicator of behaviour. EU organ donation analogy given. Example is the amazon register page: the button says generic ‘continue’ to cover both user sign in and sign up.
* “only subtle references to what is being done, which implies users have no decisions to be make”
* “squint test” to check for calls to action: look at the whole page (e.g. zoomed out) to check what is most dominant to see, e.g. comparison of poor Irish government website with the very good “gov.uk” site for the initiation of the process of passport application i.e. how to start it, where “gov.uk” has a clear green “start now” button.
* chunking related fields into similar sections, separated, is a very good idea.
* mandatory fields, e.g. Baymerd design pattern with ‘(optional)’ afterwards on non-mandatory fields.
* “affordance” is the degree to which something is:

    1. natural;
    2. discoverable;
    3. obvious.

##### Feedback

* Two types of feedback:

    1. let the user know what happens i.e. *pro-active feedback*;
    2. let the user know that you have got/received their input.

* *micro feedback*: Shazam example on getting audio.

* Error handling for mistakes: for negative feedback, make sure the tone and style (etc.) that communicate it is *proportional* to the level of the problem! e.g. be conversational & don’t use “!!!” and capitals for a typo leading to an invalid field.

* UX crime: “blanking the form” on a user!

##### Fitts’s Law

* applicable elsewhere (e.g. in physical nature) but in software, defined as “the calls to action, i.e. the most important actions, should be big and close and immediate and obvious.”

* constraints: most common in software; i.e. to constrain input fields e.g. keypad-constrained to numbers for phone numbers.

##### Exercise: prototype/sketch for a redesign of StennaLine from the UT of day 1

* this included trying out the Marvel prototyping app, where have areas on photos in which can move between photos to act as an interactive model.

* UX checklist given (see slides).
